# LegendaryPokemonIdentification
In the Pokémon world, there exists a group of rare and often powerful Pokémon, known as Legendary Pokémon.

Unfortunately, there is no explicit criteria which defines these Pokémon.
The only way to identify a Legendary Pokémon is through statements from official media, such as the game or anime.
The question then popped into my head.

**What if we could we could use Machine Learning to identify Legendary Pokémon?**

In this project, I explored the **Pokemon with Stats** dataset and used the Random Forest Algorithm identify Legendary Pokémon.
